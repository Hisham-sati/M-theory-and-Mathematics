## Abstracts

**David Berman: Machine learning and M-theory?**

Abstract: TBD

**Peter Bouwknegt: Higher spin algebras and representation theory**

In this talk I will discuss higher spin algebras from the point of view 
   of universal enveloping algebras and their ideals.


**Martin Cederwall: Supersymmetry, nilpotent varieties and superalgebras**

Supermultiplets can be constructed as the cohomology of a “pure spinor” superspace 
BRST operator. The pure spinor constraint is, in many cases, related to a superalgebra via 
Koszul duality. I will sketch the generalisation of this statement to situations when one instead 
obtains an L-infinity algebra. I will also describe how the partition function for the pure spinor 
encodes the full content of the supermultiplet. The same mathematics is relevant for extended geometry.

**Bianca Letizia Cerchiai: Supergraphity: Supergravity in a Pencil**

In the spirit of the gauge-gravity correspondence, we derive a  2+1 dimensional 
model with “unconventional” supersymmetry at the boundary of a 4-dimensional Anti de 
Sitter  N-extended supergravity, which in the case N=2 reproduces the AVZ model 
[P.D. Alvarez, M. Valenzuela, J. Zanelli, JHEP 1204 (2012) 058,  arXiv:1109.3944 [hep-th]].
The extended supersymmetry of the boundary model is instrumental to describe the 
electronic properties of  graphene, in particular at the two Dirac points K and K'. The  
two valleys correspond to the two independent sectors of the  OSp(p|2)×OSp(q|2) boundary 
model in the p=q case, which  are related by a parity transformation. The Semenoff and 
the  Haldane masses entering the corresponding Dirac equations for  the graphene 
pseudoparticles are identified with supergravity torsion parameters.


**Michael Duff: Perspectives on M-theory (TBC)**

Abstract: TBD

**José Figueroa-O’Farrill: Lie superalgebra deformations and d=11 supergravity backgrounds**

To every (supersymmetric) background of d=11 supergravity there is 
associated a filtered Lie superalgebra.  For (>1/2)-BPS backgrounds, this Lie 
superalgebra determines the background up to local isometry.  I will then report 
on an algebraic reformulation of this classification problem.  This is joint work 
with Andrea Santi.

**Domenico Fiorenza: Twisted cohomotopy and the level quantization of the 6d Wess-Zumino term**

The 6d Wess-Zumino term in the action functional for theM5-brane is anomalous as traditionally defined. What has been missing is a condition implying a higher analogue of level quantization familiar from the 2d Wess-Zumino term. We prove that such an anomaly cancellation condition is implied by the hypothesis thatt he C-field is charge-quantized in twisted cohomotopy theory. The proof follows by a twisted/parametrized generalization of the Hopf invariant, after identifying the 6d Wess-Zumino term with a twisted homotopy Whitehead integral formula, which we establish. Joint work with Hisham Sati and Urs Schreiber, arXiv:1906.07417.


**Pietro Grassi: The Integral Form of Supergravity**

We discuss a new framework to formulate supersymmetric quantum 
field theories which encompasses all possible superspace descriptions, in any 
dimensions and for any extended version of supersymmetry. We will describe 
several examples from rigid supersymmetric models to supergravity models in 
higher dimensions. We also discuss their quantization and the BV-BRST formalism 
in this new framework. Finally, the case of 11 dimensional supergravity is also 
discussed.


**Fei Han: Projective elliptic genera and elliptic pseudodifferential genera**

Elliptic genera is a modular form valued topological invariant, which lies 
on the intersection of Atiyah-Singer index theory, loop space, infinite dimensional 
Lie algebra and quantum field theory. Given a projective vector bundle, we will show 
how to use it to twist the usual elliptic genera to get projective elliptic genera and give 
them analytic interpretation via the projective index theory of Mathai-Melrose-Singer. 
As an application, we will describe how to construct the elliptic pseudodifferential 
genera for any elliptic pseudodifferential operator. This represents our joint work 
with Mathai.


**Yang-Hui He: Universes as Big data: Superstrings, Calabi-Yau Manifolds and Machine-Learning**

We review how historically the problem of string phenomenology lead theoretical 
physics first to algebraic/differential geometry, and then to computational geometry, 
and now to data science and AI. With the concrete playground of the Calabi-Yau landscape,
accumulated by the collaboration of physicists, mathematicians and computer scientists 
over the last 4 decades, we show how the latest techniques in machine-learning can help 
explore problems of physical and mathematical interest.
 

**Chris Hull: Dualities, K3, Exotic Branes and Orientifolds**

Abstract: TBD

**Branislav Jurco: Homotopy algebras in string field theory**

(Quantum) homotopy algebras (Lie, Associative, involutive bi-Algebras,...) 
and their relevance to string field theory will be reviewed.


**Neil Lambert: Lagrangians with (2,0) supersymmetry**

We will discuss free and interacting six-dimensional 
actions which admit (2,0) supersymmetry including  their 
application to abelian and non-abelian M5-branes

**William Linch III: Off-shell Supersymmetry and the M-theory Effective Action**

The leading part of the M-theory low-energy effective action has been conjectured 
to be the minimal supersymmetric completion of a certain curvature-to-the-fourth 
correction to eleven-dimensional supergravity. 
This idea is difficult to exploit, because a component Noether procedure 
would have an infinite number of steps of ever-higher order in the curvature 
expansion. In an off-shell superspace, the supersymmetry closes independently 
of the interactions, but any 11D, N=1 superspace would put the theory on-shell. 
In this talk, I will describe an ongoing program to construct an 11D, N = 1/8 
supergeometry that is potentially “sufficiently off shell” to supersymmetrize 
the leading M-theory correction to the eleven-dimensional supergravity action. 



**Varghese Mathai: T-duality, loop space and Witten gerbe modules**

I will talk about my recent joint work with Fei Han, [arXiv:2001.00322], where we
extend what is now known as topological T-duality isomorphism on T-dual circle
bundles with background flux, to the free (small) loop space of these T-dual circle
bundles.


**Christian Saemann: Towards an M5-Brane Model: Progress Report**

I present recent work exploring and defining higher structures 
required for a potential classical description of M5-branes. I start with a
discussion of metric string structures, which provide good examples of
higher gauge structures expected in M5-brane models. Next, I discuss an
adjusted form of higher parallel transport, which does not require fake
flatness. Finally, I'll report on progress with the Lagrangian and how
to replace the PST-part by Sen's new formalism, yielding the same amount
of self-duality.


**Henning Samtleben: Exceptional field theories and AdS compactifications**

Exceptional field theories are the duality covariant formulations of 
higher-dimensional supergravity theories. I review the formalism and
its applications for the study of AdS compactifications.

**Hisham Sati: M-theory and cohomotopy**

Cohomotopy theory has recently emerged as the proper generalized cohomology theory 
to describe the fields in M-theory. It is hoped that viewing 
M-theory  from a mathematical perspective will shed the light on the 
nature of the theory and will allow for progress. I will survey this area, illustrating 
how cohomotopy captures the nature of the C-field and its dual as well as of the 
M-branes, allows for cancellation of various anomalies, and provides a firm 
grounding for further study of M-theory. This is joint work Urs Schreiber 
and Domenico Fiorenza.


**Urs Schreiber: Microscopic brane physics from Cohomotopy theory**

As reviewed in H. Sati‘s talk, assuming that the C-field is
charge-quantized in the generalized cohomology theory called J-twisted
Cohomotopy (“Hypothesis H”) implies a list of M-theoretic anomaly
cancellation conditions, such as shifted C-field flux quantization,
DMW anomaly cancellation and C-field tadpole cancellation on
8-manifolds. In this talk I review the further geometric refinement of
the cohomology theory to equivariant Cohomotoy theory and to
differential Cohomotopy theory. Now we find that Hypothesis H implies
also the Witten mechanism of multiple M5-branes on MO5-orientifolds in
heterotic M-theory on ADE-orbifolds, hence RR-field tadpole
cancellation in type I' string theory; as well as a multitude of
effects associated with Dp/D(p+2)-brane intersections: Chan-Paton
factors, BMN matrix model fuzzy funnel states and BLG 3-algebras, the
Hanany-Witten rules, AdS3-gravity observables, supersymmetric indices
of Coulomb branches as well as gauge/gravity duality between all
these. This suggest that Hypothesis H is a correct assumption about
the elusive mathematical fomulation of M-theory. This is joint work
with H. Sati (arxiv:1909.12277, arxiv:1912.10425).

**Ashoke Sen: Gravitational waves from soft theorem**

Abstract: TBD

**Eric Sharpe: Decomposition of two-dimensional theories with one-form symmetries**

In this talk, we will discuss two-dimensional theories with discrete
one-form symmetries, examples (which we have been studying
since 2005), their properties, and gauging of the one-form symmetry.
Their most important property is that such theories decompose into a
disjoint union of theories, recently deemed 'universes'
This decomposition has the effect of restricting allowed nonperturbative
sectors, in a fashion one might deem a 'multiverse interference effect',
which has had applications in topics including Gromov-Witten theory and
gauged linear sigma model phases.  After reviewing one-form symmetries
and decomposition in general, we will discuss a particular 
example in detail to explicitly illustrate these properties and 
to demonstrate how
gauging the one-form symmetry projects onto summands in the
decomposition.  If time permits, we will briefly review
analogous phenomena in four-dimensional theories with three-form symmetries,
as recently studied by Tanizaki and Unsal.


**Dmitri Sorokin: How SYM domain walls look like?**

We will review main features of the pure N=1, D=4 SYM and its effective 
description by the Veneziano-Yankielowicz generalized sigma-model. We will then 
argue that the construction of 1/2 BPS domain walls interpolating between different 
SYM vacua requires the presence of a dynamical membrane source. We will show 
how such an M-brane is coupled to the SYM and present the explicit form of the 
BPS domain walls which it creates in the Veneziano-Yankielowicz effective theory.

**Meng-Chwan Tan: Unifying Lattice Models, Links and Quantum Geometric Langlands via Branes 
in String Theory**

I will explain how, starting with a stack of D4-branes ending on an NS5-brane 
in type IIA string theory, one can, via T-duality and the topological-holomorphic nature 
of the relevant worldvolume theories, relate (i) the lattice models realized by Costello's 
4d Chern-Simons theory, (ii) links in 3d analytically-continued Chern-Simons theory, 
(iii) the quantum geometric Langlands correspondence realized by Kapustin-Witten 
using 4d N = 4 gauge theory and its quantum group modification, and (iv) the 
Gaitsgory-Lurie conjecture relating quantum groups/affine Kac-Moody algebras 
to Whittaker D-modules/W-algebras. This furnishes, purely physically via branes 
in string theory, a novel bridge between the mathematics of integrable systems, 
geometric topology, geometric representation theory, and quantum algebras.
